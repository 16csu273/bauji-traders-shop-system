# Enhanced Search Functionality - Barcode Support

## üéØ Feature Overview
The inventory management system now supports **dual search functionality** - you can search for products using either:
- **Product Name** (existing functionality)
- **Barcode** (new functionality)
- **Both simultaneously** in the same search field

## üîç Where This Works

### 1. **Main Sales/Billing Interface** (shop_gui.py)
- **Location**: Main product search field in the billing interface
- **Label**: "Search (Name/Barcode):"
- **Functionality**: Real-time filtering as you type

### 2. **Inventory Management** (shop_gui.py)
- **Location**: Inventory tab search field  
- **Label**: "üîç Search Products (Name/Barcode):"
- **Functionality**: Filter inventory by product name or barcode

### 3. **Barcode Manager** (shop_gui.py)
- **Location**: Barcode assignment interface
- **Label**: "Search (Name/Barcode):"
- **Functionality**: Find products for barcode assignment/removal

### 4. **Stock Management** (stock_manager.py)
- **Location**: Stock adjustment and stock movements
- **Prompt**: "üîç Search product (name or barcode):"
- **Functionality**: Console-based search with barcode support

## üéÆ How to Use

### Example Searches:
```
Search Term          | Finds
---------------------|--------------------------------
"SAVOUR"             | All products containing "SAVOUR"
"8906020730601"      | Product with that exact barcode
"89060207"           | All products with barcodes starting with "89060207"
"tea"                | All products containing "tea" (case insensitive)
"VERMICELLI"         | All products containing "VERMICELLI"
```

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Code Changes:
1. **Enhanced filter functions** to search both name and barcode columns
2. **Proper barcode data handling** (string type, handling NaN values)
3. **Combined search logic** using pandas boolean indexing
4. **Updated UI labels** to indicate barcode search support

### Search Logic:
```python
# Search by name OR barcode
name_match = df['Product_Name'].str.lower().str.contains(search_term, na=False)
barcode_match = df['Barcode'].str.lower().str.contains(search_term, na=False)
results = df[name_match | barcode_match]
```

## ‚úÖ Benefits

1. **Faster Product Location**: Scan or type barcode to instantly find products
2. **Reduced Errors**: Direct barcode search eliminates name-based confusion
3. **Better Workflow**: Supports both manual typing and barcode scanning
4. **Unified Experience**: Same search field works for both names and barcodes
5. **Case Insensitive**: Works regardless of upper/lower case input

## üéØ Perfect for:
- **Barcode Scanning**: Direct barcode input from scanners
- **Product Lookup**: Quick product identification
- **Stock Management**: Easier inventory tracking
- **Sales Processing**: Faster billing with barcode support

---
*This enhancement maintains backward compatibility - all existing name-based searches continue to work exactly as before, with the added bonus of barcode search capability.*
